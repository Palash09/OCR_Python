Here python is used to implement an OCR. The processing of image is completed through an API provided by OCR space.
This free API helps to extract the text from the image provided. The shrinking of image is also done to reduce the time latency
which is experienced during transfer of image to the server.

The accuracy of text detection has achieved 90% accuracy. The accuracy also depends on the type of image being given as input,
otherwise the results have been satisfactory.
